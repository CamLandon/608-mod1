# 608-mod1
My notes and practice from Module 1
Part 1

Paste a clickable link to your public GitHub repo: 
https://github.com/CamLandon/608-mod1

About how long did you spend: roughly 30-45 minutes
What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
I had already created a file on my machine called 608-mod1, so when I was attempting to clone the file from GitHub, I was receiving a "fatal" message in GitBash. I had to rename the folder that I had created myself to something else. Tried it again and it worked. I also, had to go back through my screenshots from earlier in the week to remind myself how to use the cd command in GitBash to make sure I'm cloning into the correct folder. 
What did you find most interesting?
